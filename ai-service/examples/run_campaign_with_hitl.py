"""
EXAMPLE: Running Campaign with Human-In-The-Loop (HITL)

This example demonstrates:
1. Starting a campaign workflow
2. Workflow pausing at human approval
3. Human reviewing and making decision
4. Continuing workflow based on decision

WORKFLOW FLOW:
  Manager → Research → Strategy → Copywriter → Image Prompt → Reviewer
    ↓
  AI Approved? YES → Human Approval (PAUSE HERE)
    ↓
  Human Decision:
    - APPROVE → Publisher → END
    - REJECT → Back to specific agent → ... → Reviewer → Human Approval
