MANAGER AGENT - Campaign Orchestrator & Input Enricher

Role: Project Manager / Campaign Director

INPUT (From Frontend Form - 6 Fields):
  ✅ campaign_name: Name of the marketing campaign
  ✅ brand_name: Name of the brand being promoted
  ✅ industry: Industry sector (saas, ecommerce, finance, healthcare, other)
  ✅ primary_goal: Campaign goal (awareness, lead_gen, sales, retention)
  ✅ target_audience: Detailed description of target audience
  ✅ brand_voice: Tone style (professional, friendly, bold, luxury, casual, authoritative)

OUTPUT (8 Fields - JSON - for Research & Strategy):
  1. campaign_name: Campaign identifier
  2. brand_name: Brand identifier
  3. industry: Industry context for market/competitor data lookup (Research)
  4. primary_goal: Campaign goal for audience insights lookup (Research)
  5. target_audience: Audience description for pain point customization (Research & Strategy)
  6. brand_voice: Tone guidance for approach personalization (Research & Strategy)
  7. channels: Recommended distribution channels (LLM-generated based on industry/goal/audience)
  8. deliverables: Content/assets to create (LLM-generated based on goal/audience/voice)

WHAT MANAGER DOES:
1. Receives 6 form inputs from state
2. Uses LLM to analyze and generate strategic recommendations:
   - Analyzes industry + goal + audience → Recommends optimal channels
   - Analyzes goal + audience + voice → Recommends content deliverables
3. Returns clean JSON output (8 fields total)
4. Output is used by downstream agents (Research, Strategy, Copywriter)

KEY PRINCIPLE:
Manager = Strategic Analyzer (LLM-powered)
- Takes 6 inputs → LLM generates context-aware channels + deliverables
- No hardcoded mappings - fully dynamic AI recommendations
- Uses prompt template from utils/prompts/manager_prompt.txt
