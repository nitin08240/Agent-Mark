PUBLISHER AGENT - Campaign Distribution & Publishing Planner

Role: Senior Campaign Distribution Strategist

INPUT (From All Upstream Agents + State):
  FROM state (metadata - direct access):
    ✅ campaign_name: Campaign identifier
    ✅ brand_name: Brand name
    ✅ industry: Industry sector
    ✅ primary_goal: Campaign goal
    ✅ target_audience: Audience description
    ✅ brand_voice: Tone and style

  FROM manager_output (REQUIRED - 2 fields):
    ✅ channels: Distribution channels list
    ✅ deliverables: Content deliverables list

  FROM strategy_output (REQUIRED - key fields):
    ✅ inferred_goal: awareness / lead_gen / sales / retention
    ✅ timeline: Campaign phases with dates
    ✅ success_metrics: KPIs aligned with goal
    ✅ channel_strategy: Per-channel strategic priorities
    ✅ execution.channels: Final channel list
    ✅ execution.deliverables: Final deliverables

  FROM copy_output (OPTIONAL - safe defaults if missing):
    ✅ copy_readiness: Per-channel readiness flags
    ✅ Channel copy blobs (headlines, CTAs per channel)

  FROM image_output (OPTIONAL - safe defaults if missing):
    ✅ visual_direction: Overall visual strategy
    ✅ image_prompts[].deliverable: Visual asset names
    ✅ image_prompts[].aspect_ratio: Aspect ratios

  FROM review_output (OPTIONAL - defaults to approved if missing):
    ✅ overall.quality_score: 0-100 score
    ✅ overall.approved: Approval status
    ✅ Per-agent reviews + issues

OUTPUT (publisher_output JSON):
  1. publishing_decision: APPROVED_FOR_PUBLISHING / REVISIONS_NEEDED / HOLD
  2. decision_rationale: Why this decision was made
  3. publishing_plan: Per-channel distribution plan with priority, timing, KPIs
  4. content_calendar: Week-by-week activity breakdown
  5. asset_checklist: Copy + visual asset readiness inventory
  6. projected_metrics: Reach, leads, CTR, cost, ROI estimates
  7. executive_summary: 3-5 sentence campaign overview

HOW IT WORKS:
1. Extract all upstream agent outputs from state
2. Load publisher prompt template
3. Send ALL context to LLM for comprehensive publishing plan generation
4. Parse LLM response to get complete distribution strategy
5. Update state with publisher_output and mark status as completed

KEY PRINCIPLE:
Publisher = LLM-Powered Distribution Strategist
- Takes all upstream outputs → LLM generates comprehensive publishing plan
- No hardcoded lookup tables or rule-based logic - fully dynamic AI planning
- Uses prompt template from utils/prompts/publisher_prompt.txt
