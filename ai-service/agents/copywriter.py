COPYWRITER AGENT - Marketing Copy & Messaging Creator

Role: Creative Copywriter / Marketing Messaging Expert

INPUT (From Strategy Agent + State):
  FROM state (metadata - direct access):
    ✅ campaign_name: Campaign identifier
    ✅ brand_name: Brand for consistent messaging
    ✅ brand_voice: Tone and style (professional, friendly, bold, luxury, casual, authoritative)
    ✅ brief: Campaign context and objectives

  FROM strategy_output (PRIMARY INPUT - 13 fields):
    ✅ positioning: Brand positioning statement
    ✅ key_messages: 3 key messages
    ✅ content_pillars: 4 content themes
    ✅ audience_segments: 3 audience segments
    ✅ channel_strategy: Prioritized channel plans
    ✅ timeline: 4 campaign phases
    ✅ success_metrics: KPIs and targets
    ✅ competitive_differentiation: Competitive positioning
    ✅ market_opportunities: Tactical opportunities
    ✅ strategic_approach: Overall strategic direction
    ✅ inferred_goal: Campaign objective (awareness/lead_gen/sales/retention)
    ✅ research_foundation: Market/competitor/audience data
    ✅ execution: Channels + deliverables + budget

OUTPUT (Channel-Organized Copy - JSON - ready for execution):
  1. inferred_goal: Campaign goal from Strategy
  2. Dynamic channel keys (instagram, tiktok, youtube, facebook, linkedin, twitter, email, google_ads):
     - Each channel has: headline, body, ctas (3-4 platform-specific CTAs)
     - Only generates copy for channels in the campaign
  3. messaging_framework: Complete messaging architecture for all channels
  4. strategic_alignment: Strategy validation
  5. copy_readiness: Channel-specific readiness flags

HOW IT WORKS:
1. Extract strategy insights + state metadata
2. Load copywriter prompt template
3. Send all context to LLM for copy generation
4. Parse LLM response to get complete channel-organized copy
5. Update state with copy output

KEY PRINCIPLE:
Copywriter = LLM-Powered Creative Engine
- Takes strategy + research insights → LLM generates compelling copy
- No hardcoded templates - fully dynamic AI copywriting
- Uses prompt template from utils/prompts/copywriter_prompt.txt
